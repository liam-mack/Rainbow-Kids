While I enjoy working with each age group, I am especially fond of the toddler ages.  It just amazes me how much a child can change, learn and grow within 12 months. There sense of wonder about the world around them really astonishes me.\n When I am not at work, I enjoy cooking, reading, and spending time outdoors as much as possible."
