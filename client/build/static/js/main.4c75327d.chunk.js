Music, creative movement field trips and outdoor experiences enrich the children's experience.","Rainbow Kidschool offers stimulating after-school program for kindergarten-age children as well as full day programs for all non-school days including summer. After school children engage in self-initiated activities, as well as educator-directed learning opportunities, supported by HDLH (How Does Learning Happen) practices.

Once inside the children enjoy a nutritious snack and are offered activities such as art projects, small group activities and games, literacy and numeracy experiences and construction opportunities.","Our school Age program allows children many opportunities to begin to take ownership and responsibilities for both the room they are in and their daily activities. From what games they wish to play, what art activities they would like to work on, ensuring the cubby areas are neat and tidy, answering the classroom phone and planning their afternoon snacks, this collaboration between children and educators allows for a stimulating and engaging program that the children are excited to attend every day."],modalFooter:["Families are able to enrol their children for either a full day (7:30 am - 5:30 pm) or half day (8:00 am - 1:00 pm).","Non-school day programming expands on the after school experiences as well as opportunities for community field trips.","Non-school days allow the children the opportunity to plan for and participate in a relaxing day of activities that they are interested in.
